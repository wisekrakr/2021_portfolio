              An open source sip phone with push to talk capabilities.
              CommUniWise provides an object-oriented Java API for embedding
              two-way G722 encoded audio. This is a pure client-side solution
              and requires zero server-side logic.

              A small javascript game, made for J13kGames Game Jam in 2019.
              Without any javascript knowledge, I had to make this game within a
              month and taught myself a bit of javascript in the process. This
              is a smaller, javascript version of a bigger java game that was
              never finished. This can also be found on my github.

              This java app works with certificates. The server (Certificate
              Authority) will ask for the client's private key (within a
              certificate) as authentication. This app will encrypt and decrypt
              the files based of of these keys.

              Working with certificates has many avenues, so I tried again, this
              time creating SSL connections, between multiple clients. This

              (including audio messages), protocol buffers, multithreading and
              multiplexing, and much more.

              To teach myself to work with Spring, React.js, node.js and
              databases like MongoDb and Firebase, using various API's to get
              and manipulate data, I created multiple web sites and apps. The
              biggest one is a social network site, where people get together
              and share knowledge. Test it out!

          David is a motivated self-taught developer with a versatile background
          looking for further development of his skills in a professional
          environment.

          With extensive creativity, the ability to see situations from
          different perspectives and a good sense of logic, programming was the
          ideal route to follow. After following different creative ambitions
          for a period, a greater challenge was sought, a place where his
          creativity and reasoning could come together. The focus of the study
          was primarily on learning the Java programming language, while
          emphasizing the correct modulation of the code. From an idea, study
          work was sought out and then various projects were made, in order to
          ultimately form a broad knowledge of Java, Javascript and a bit of c#.
